## Introducing Window Functions With OVER [7]

- Window functions allow you to **include aggregate calculations without changing the output**
- The aggregate calculation is tacked as an **additional column**
- It is possible to **group these calculations** like we can with aggregate queries, using the PARTITION

**Aggregate Functions** collapse you rows in a groups based on unique values in a columns you inslude in the select statement

vs.

**Window Functions** - allow to retaint all row delails while perfirming the same type of aggregate calculations. sum or count

```sql
use AdventureWorks2019;

select * from Sales.SalesOrderHeader;
select TotalDue, * from Sales.SalesOrderHeader;
select sum(TotalDue) from Sales.SalesOrderHeader; -- 123216786.1159, loose all columns and rows

select 
TotalSales = sum(TotalDue),
SalesPersonID
from Sales.SalesOrderHeader
group by SalesPersonID;

--YTD Sales Via Aggregate Query:
SELECT [Total YTD Sales] = SUM(SalesYTD)
      ,[Max YTD Sales] = MAX(SalesYTD)
FROM AdventureWorks2019.Sales.SalesPerson
--Total YTD Sales	Max YTD Sales
--36277591.9034		4251368.5497


-- Aggregate Functions collapse you rows in a groups based on unique values in a columns you inslude in the select statement
-- vs.
-- Window Functions - allow to retaint all row delails while perfirming the same type of aggregate calculations. sum or count

-- OVER() keyword

--YTD Sales With OVER:

SELECT BusinessEntityID
      ,TerritoryID
      ,SalesQuota
      ,Bonus
      ,CommissionPct
      ,SalesYTD
	  ,SalesLastYear
      ,[Total YTD Sales] = SUM(SalesYTD) OVER()
      ,[Max YTD Sales] = MAX(SalesYTD) OVER()
      ,[% of Best Performer] = SalesYTD / MAX(SalesYTD) OVER()

FROM AdventureWorks2019.Sales.SalesPerson
```

## Introducing Window Functions With OVER - Exercises [8]

```sql
-- Introducing Window Functions With OVER - Exercises

-- Exercise 1
-- Create a query with the following columns:
-- FirstName and LastName, from the Person.Person table**
-- JobTitle, from the HumanResources.Employee table**
-- Rate, from the HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory table**
-- A derived column called "AverageRate" that returns the average of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row
-- **All the above tables can be joined on BusinessEntityID
-- All the tables can be inner joined, and you do not need to apply any criteria.

select avg(Rate) from  HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory -- 17.7588

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, hre.JobTitle, hist.Rate,
	AverageRate = AVG(hist.Rate) OVER() -- 17.7588
from Person.Person p
inner join HumanResources.Employee hre
on p.BusinessEntityID = hre.BusinessEntityID
inner join HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory hist
on p.BusinessEntityID = hist.BusinessEntityID
order by Rate

-- Exercise 2
-- Enhance your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called
-- "MaximumRate" that returns the largest of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row.

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, hre.JobTitle, hist.Rate,
	AverageRate = AVG(hist.Rate) OVER(), -- 17.7588
	MaximumRate = MAX(hist.Rate) OVER()
from Person.Person p
inner join HumanResources.Employee hre
on p.BusinessEntityID = hre.BusinessEntityID
inner join HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory hist
on p.BusinessEntityID = hist.BusinessEntityID
order by Rate desc
--Ken	SÃ¡nchez	Chief Executive Officer	125.50	17.7588	125.50

-- Exercise 3
-- Enhance your query from Exercise 2 by adding a derived column called
-- "DiffFromAvgRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:
-- An employees's pay rate, MINUS the average of all values in the "Rate" column.

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, hre.JobTitle, hist.Rate,
	AverageRate = AVG(hist.Rate) OVER(), -- 17.7588
	MaximumRate = MAX(hist.Rate) OVER(),
	DiffFromAvgRate = Rate - AVG(hist.Rate) OVER()
from Person.Person p
inner join HumanResources.Employee hre
on p.BusinessEntityID = hre.BusinessEntityID
inner join HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory hist
on p.BusinessEntityID = hist.BusinessEntityID
order by DiffFromAvgRate desc

-- Exercise 4
-- Enhance your query from Exercise 3 by adding a derived column called
-- "PercentofMaxRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:
-- An employees's pay rate, DIVIDED BY the maximum of all values in the "Rate" column, times 100.

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, hre.JobTitle, hist.Rate,
	AverageRate = AVG(hist.Rate) OVER(), -- 17.7588
	MaximumRate = MAX(hist.Rate) OVER(),
	DiffFromAvgRate = Rate - AVG(hist.Rate) OVER(),
	PercentofMaxRate = (Rate / MAX(hist.Rate) OVER()) * 100
from Person.Person p
inner join HumanResources.Employee hre
on p.BusinessEntityID = hre.BusinessEntityID
inner join HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory hist
on p.BusinessEntityID = hist.BusinessEntityID
order by PercentofMaxRate desc
```

## PARTITION BY [9]

- PARTITION BY - compute aggregate totals for group within our data, still retaining row-level details
- PARTITION BY - assigns each row of your query output to a group, without collapsing your data into fewer rows as with GROUP BY
- Instead of groups being assigned based on distinct values of ALL the non-aggregated columns of our data, we need to specify the columns this groups will be based on.

-SQL Server allows you to sort the result set based on the ordinal positions of columns that appear in the select list.
